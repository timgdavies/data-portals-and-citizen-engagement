As a result, they are implementing the philosophy of open government data (OGD) to make public data easily and freely available to everyone in standardized formats. Because good quality OGD can boost a country’s economy, whereas poor quality can jeopardize its efficient use and reuse, it is very important to maintain the quality of data stored in open government data portals (OGDP). However, most OGDPs do not have a feature that indicates the quality of the data stored there, and even if they do, they do not provide real-time service. Moreover, most recent studies focused on developing approaches to quantify the quality of OGD, either qualitatively or quantitatively, but did not offer an approach to automatically calculate and visualize it in real-time. To address this problem to some extent, this paper proposes a framework that can automatically assess the quality of data in the form of a data completeness ratio (DCR) and visualize it in real-time. The framework is validated using the OGD of South Korea, whose DCR is displayed in real-time using the Django-based dashboard."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/timgdavies/data-portals-and-citizen-engagement/id/dataset/dataPortalsBibliography>.

However, finding relevant data is difficult. While search engines have addressed this problem for Web documents, there are many new challenges involved in supporting the discovery of structured data. We demonstrate how the Auctus dataset search engine addresses some of these challenges. We describe the system architecture and how users can explore datasets through a rich set of queries. We also present case studies which show how Auctus supports data augmentation to improve machine learning models as well as to enrich analytics."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/timgdavies/data-portals-and-citizen-engagement/id/dataset/dataPortalsBibliography>.
