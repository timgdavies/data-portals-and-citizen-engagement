Ideally, making this data available on the web would lead to more transparency, participation and innovation throughout society. However, just publishing the data on the web is not enough. To truly advance the open society, the publication platforms need to fulfill certain legal, administrative as well as technical requirements. In this paper we present a survey of existing Open Government Data platforms, focusing on the technical aspects. We studied over fifty Open Data repositories operated by national, regional and communal governments, as well as international organizations. Features such as standardization, discoverability and machinereadability of data were taken into account. Furthermore, a subset of five repositories was examined in more detail, additionally analyzing data and metadata quality. We introduce a number of aspects of openness in order to classify the surveyed repositories and asses the state of Open Data on the web. We point out shortcomings of the existing portals regarding reusability and sketch our vision of an improved Open Data repository.
