In this chapter, we share insights from a Code for Australia fellowship conducted in South-East Queensland, Australia.Our contributions are threefold: first, we show how an exploratory and participatory approach to internal local council technology projects can serve to identify Open Data use-cases through the early involvement of local community stakeholders; second, we propose a novel role of the custodianship and facilitation of Open Data exchange and alternate composition for local governments; and third, we articulate the need and concept for co-creative practices across smart city business units, local government IT departments and civil society in particular to successfully deliver Open Data."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/timgdavies/data-portals-and-citizen-engagement/id/dataset/dataPortalsBibliography>.
