There are several ways of making data available to the public, from a simple website to sophisticated applications for accessing the data. In this context, one of the options is the construction of an open data portal using platforms for data repositories and catalogs. In the last few years, there has been a rapid proliferation of this type of portals, with domain or organization specific datasets being widely disseminated in platforms like CKAN. In these platforms, datasets are organized in thematic groups and described by keywords and other attributes assigned by the publisher. Usually described by metadata with poor semantics, these datasets very often remain as “data silos”, with no explicit connection or data integration mechanism, making it difficult for the users to locate and interrelate relevant data sources. In contrast, the Semantic Web focuses on a way of modeling and representing data in an easier manner to establish interrelationships between data, accompanied by richer descriptors. Based on this scenario, this paper proposes LigADOS, an approach to create interconnections between datasets considering their content and related metadata. LigADOS is based on the principles of the Semantic Web and associated linked data solutions and technologies, to support rich access strategies to RDF data published using portal platforms like CKAN and others."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/timgdavies/data-portals-and-citizen-engagement/id/dataset/dataPortalsBibliography>.

It is one of the primary principles of open data, which is considered to be a success factor, while at the same time it is one of the biggest barriers that can disrupt users trust in data and even the desire to use the entire open data portal. However, assessing this aspect is a very difficult task that, in most cases, becomes an impossible for open data users. There is therefore a lack of comparative studies on the timeliness of data of different national open data portals. Unfortunately, 2020 gave the opportunity to find out this. It became easy enough to compare how long is the data path from the data holder to the OGD portal by analysing the timeliness of Covid-19-related data sets in relation to the first case observed in a country. The study thus fills the gap of comparative studies by addressing 60 countries and their OGD portals concerning the timeliness of the data, providing a report on how much and what countries provide the open data as quickly as possible. It makes it possible to understand how quickly OGD portals react to emergencies by opening and updating data for their further potential reuse, which is essential in the digital data-driven world."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/timgdavies/data-portals-and-citizen-engagement/id/dataset/dataPortalsBibliography>.
