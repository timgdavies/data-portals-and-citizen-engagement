The open data (OD) movement provides publicly available data for the development of a knowledge-based society. As such, the concept of OD is a valuable information technology (IT) tool for economic, social, and human development, which adds value. To further develop these processes on a global scale, users need to manage the quality of OD in their practices. Otherwise, what is the point of using data just for the sake of using it (in science or practice) without thinking about data compliance with norms, standards, and so forth? This article aims to provide an overview of (meta)data quality dimensions, sub-dimensions, and metrics used within OD assessment-related research papers. To achieve this, the authors performed a systematic literature review (SLR) and extracted data from 86 relevant studies dealing with the evaluation of OD. The article endows the progress made so far in OD assessment research. Findings of reviewing the assessment of the OD in the light of existing (meta)data quality dimensions unveil the potential of metadata. Furthermore, the analysis disclosed the need for greater use of quantitative methods in research, and metadata can greatly assist in this."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/timgdavies/data-portals-and-citizen-engagement/id/dataset/dataPortalsBibliography>.

These actions offer the potential to improve both transportation safety and mobility. That said, an examination of the quality of data, ease of use, and availability of metadata across agencies revealed a significant variation among them and presented a serious concern to realizing the full potential of these principled efforts. This study highlights the imminent need for agency support towards assessing data warehouse quality and in establishing an index to measure performance. The approach includes a data portal evaluation rubric (DPER) that captures the essence of the National Open Data Policy. Its metrics are devised from practices implemented across several agencies to ensure the effective use of open data. The proposed DPER was applied to 43 transportation-related open data portals at the state (39) and national level (4). The DPER examines the quality, the openness of data, and the relevance of published content to the Transportation industry. The evaluation found that the portal hosted by the state of New York scored the highest due to its user-friendly interface with interactive visualization tools, relevant data content, detailed information about the data, and the useful API (Application Program Interface) references for application developers. The absolute scramble by agencies to fight the life-impacting events of 2020 emphasizes both the need and urgency to provide standardized, accessible, and accurate data for a ubiquitous audience."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/timgdavies/data-portals-and-citizen-engagement/id/dataset/dataPortalsBibliography>.
