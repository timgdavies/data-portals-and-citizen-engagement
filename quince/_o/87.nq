Furthermore we enrich the harvested datasets by heuristic annotations using the type hierarchies in existing Knowledge Graphs. We both (i) present the underlying distributed architecture to scale up regular harvesting and monitoring changes on these portals, and (ii) make the corpus available via different APIs. Moreover, we (iii) analyse the characteristics of tabular data within the corpus. Our APIs can be used to regularly run such analyses or to reproduce experiments from the literature that have worked on static, not publicly available corpora."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/timgdavies/data-portals-and-citizen-engagement/id/dataset/dataPortalsBibliography>.
