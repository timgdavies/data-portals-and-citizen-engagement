However, most existing solutions have not been envisaged as sustainable approaches to cope with key data attributes such as timeliness, accessibility and usability. In this paper, we present a framework that addresses these challenges and ensures the efficient publication of dynamic data on open data platforms, as well as improving the consumption experience of end-users. The framework describes the architecture of a sustainable system that can operate continuously in an automated way. It involves: 1) introducing an evolvable and scalable ecosystem to guarantee the access to dynamic data when they are made available; 2) tackling governance using an autonomous agent to provide the capacity of dynamically publishing/unpublishing data resources on open data platforms. It ensures easier accessibility and greater efficiency for data developers, facilitating the development of data-enabled products, thus helping developers to seize the opportunities of the data economy; and 3) improving the consumption experience by introducing conversational bots, which enhances the usability of open data. We demonstrate the results and validity of the solution in practice through its implementation, evaluation and exploitation as a practical system in the Parliament of the Canary Islands, Spain. The framework developed can be considered a generic solution to manage open data publishing and consumption challenges in other domains."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/timgdavies/data-portals-and-citizen-engagement/id/dataset/dataPortalsBibliography>.
