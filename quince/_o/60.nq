The open data approach can be used to increase the transparency of public administrations. Hence, thousands of open datasets published by governments, organizations and companies, were made available through portals on internet. In recent years, the growth in the number of portals and the amount of information available has increased users' difficulty in obtaining useful information for conducting analyzes or studies. In a majority of portals the datasets are distributed across selected topics or categories. As such, users may take some time to understand the organization of the datasets in each portal they browse, what hinders a comprehensive and effective access to information. In this work, we conducted a study about how the 100 different portals of the most populous cities in the United States categorize their datasets. As a result, we identified the most relevant categories, based on the frequency of occurrence in these portals. Furthermore, we suggest a method that provides a generic categorization of datasets among several urban data portals that could simplify user interaction with these portals."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/timgdavies/data-portals-and-citizen-engagement/id/dataset/dataPortalsBibliography>.
