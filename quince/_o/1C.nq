First, the context of the project is discussed: the issue of quality of open data, its relevance in Austria and how ADEQUATe attempts to tackle these matters. Then the main components of the project are introduced, outlining how they support the goals of the project: Portal Watch managing monitoring, quality assessment and enhancement of data, the ADEQUATe Knowledge Base providing the backbone to the search and semantic enrichment components, the faceted Search functionality, Dataset profiles presenting an enriched overview of individual datasets to users, ADEQUATe’s GitLab instance providing the community dimension to the portal, and Odalic, a tool for semantic interpretation of tabular data. The paper is concluded with an outlook to the benefits of the project: easier data discovery, increased insight to data evolution, community engagement leading to contribution by a wider part of the population, increased transparency and democratization as well as positive feedback loops with data maintainers, public administration and the private sector."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/timgdavies/data-portals-and-citizen-engagement/id/dataset/dataPortalsBibliography>.
