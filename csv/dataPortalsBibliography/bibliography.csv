One of the great benefits that Semantic Web (SW) technology offers is facilitating the large scale integration and sharing of distributed data sources. At the heart of information policy in the UK, the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) is the part of the UK government charged with enabling the greater re-use of public sector information.

Furthermore, institutions such as the United Nations, World Bank and the African Development Bank. Seeking ways to harness value from open data, these countries and institutions have established open data portals to serve as technical enablers, easing access to public data and acting as one-stop shop for a wide variety of data ranging from environment, education, health, transportation, geo-location, budget, weather, consumer products and consumer finance. These portals do not only enable citizens to access a wide variety of datasets but through APIs allow citizens to transform the data into innovative applications or solutions that solve local challenges and societal problems, thus, improve quality of life for citizens. Sequel to the possibilities that surrounds open data portal, it will be helpful to have an open data portal in Namibia. Consequently, to bridge the gap between the citizens, data and information, an open data portal becomes necessary. In this paper we provide practical, yet technical insights on how an open data portal we developed will ease access to information and facilitate the development of innovative solutions that will aid communities in solving societal problems in Namibia.","2016-08","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","","80-86","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","","accountability; Africa; Computer science; Government; innovation; Open data; portal; Portals; Publishing; service delivery; Technological innovation; transparency; Urban areas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 2nd International Conference on Open and Big Data (OBD)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our findings suggest four streams of research: 1) description and evaluation of specific examples of OGD visualization, 2) general tools and frameworks, 3) users' needs assessments and evaluation of usability, and 4) other user-related outcomes. While there is a growing robust literature describing specific cases, further empirical research is needed on evaluating the usability of OGD visualizations and tools for different audiences.

The method infers simple types in the data and query; automatically refines queries, where that makes sense; extracts relevant subsets of the complete table; and generates both graphical and tabular summaries of what remains.

As a result, they are implementing the philosophy of open government data (OGD) to make public data easily and freely available to everyone in standardized formats. Because good quality OGD can boost a country’s economy, whereas poor quality can jeopardize its efficient use and reuse, it is very important to maintain the quality of data stored in open government data portals (OGDP). However, most OGDPs do not have a feature that indicates the quality of the data stored there, and even if they do, they do not provide real-time service. Moreover, most recent studies focused on developing approaches to quantify the quality of OGD, either qualitatively or quantitatively, but did not offer an approach to automatically calculate and visualize it in real-time. To address this problem to some extent, this paper proposes a framework that can automatically assess the quality of data in the form of a data completeness ratio (DCR) and visualize it in real-time. The framework is validated using the OGD of South Korea, whose DCR is displayed in real-time using the Django-based dashboard.","2021-01","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-11-15 20:23:59","9270","","19","11","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 19 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/8X3SWT3P/htm.html; /Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/V4M22B6P/Bhandari et al_2021_An Automatic Data Completeness Check Framework for Open Government Data.pdf","","","application programming interface; data completeness ratio; data quality; Django; open government data; open government data portal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"PK2IKVE8","document","","Braunschweig, Katrin; Eberius, Julian; Thiele, Maik; Lehner, Wolfgang; Dresden, Technische Universität","The State of Open Data Limits of Current Open Data Platforms","","","","","","Following the Open Data trend, governments and public agencies have started making their data available to the public using web portals, web services or REST interfaces. Ideally, making this data available on the web would lead to more transparency, participation and innovation throughout society. However, just publishing the data on the web is not enough. To truly advance the open society, the publication platforms need to fulfill certain legal, administrative as well as technical requirements. In this paper we present a survey of existing Open Government Data platforms, focusing on the technical aspects. We studied over fifty Open Data repositories operated by national, regional and communal governments, as well as international organizations. Features such as standardization, discoverability and machinereadability of data were taken into account. Furthermore, a subset of five repositories was examined in more detail, additionally analyzing data and metadata quality. We introduce a number of aspects of openness in order to classify the surveyed repositories and asses the state of Open Data on the web. We point out shortcomings of the existing portals regarding reusability and sketch our vision of an improved Open Data repository.

Open Data (OD) initiatives are achieving less citizens' engagement than expected. Hence, the need to find other ways and services to obtain more engagement and extract value from OD. This paper introduces an architectural model to design software platforms with the objective to increase public value through collective participation of citizens, public administrations and key stakeholders. The architectural model originates from the Data-Information-Knowledge hierarchy, where greater value is at the top of the pyramid, in information and knowledge gathered from data. Thus, the architectural model adds the collaborative and presentation layers to the classical data layer; citizens, public administrations, and stakeholders form groups of interests to understand, reason and interpret Open Data to gather information and generate knowledge that will be communicated to the general audience over Internet, thus, increasing public value. The paper describes three platform instances: the ROUTE-TO-PA ecosystem, the data.world, and DKAN, which functionalities can be mapped onto the architectural model proposed in the paper. Furthermore, the paper describes HETOR, a concreate experience of exploitation of the architectural model and the ROUTE-TO-PA ecosystem with groups of students and associations of citizens, who collaborated together to ultimately generate new knowledge for Cultural Heritage to be communicated over Internet through blog posts.","2018-04-04","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-11-16","371–381","","","","","","A Layered Architecture for Open Data","ICEGOV '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","","E-Participation; Open Data; Open Government","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The methodology is iterative, incremental, evolutionary, test-driven, and collaborative. The novel idea is that PAs produce open data and, at same time, envision and anticipate possible uses and re-uses by citizens. The opportunity is that PAs will publish use cases along with Open Data as a way to engage citizens. The fit-for-use test is a specific step of the methodology in which PAs conceive possible uses of the dataset by creating a set of relevant visualisations (e.g., charts). This step mitigates some well-known barriers in the field of the OD, such as, that the data could be not accurate, not interesting, or too costly to be re-used [27]. The paper describes a platform named SPOD, based on the above agile methodology, meant to be used by PAs over their Intranet to support the collaborative process to make data publicly available. Moreover, the methodology and the SPOD have specific steps to assist PAs in checking the dataset quality through syntactic, sanity and domain-specific steps implemented through a set of heuristics. Both the methodology and the SPOD have been successfully adopted by the Council of the Campania Region in Italy to produce their open data, this experience has detailed described and reported in the paper.","2018-05-30","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-11-16","1–10","","","","","","","dg.o '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/XU524D9S/De Donato et al_2018_Agile production of high quality open data.pdf","","","open data; open data authoring; open government","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are several ways of making data available to the public, from a simple website to sophisticated applications for accessing the data. In this context, one of the options is the construction of an open data portal using platforms for data repositories and catalogs. In the last few years, there has been a rapid proliferation of this type of portals, with domain or organization specific datasets being widely disseminated in platforms like CKAN. In these platforms, datasets are organized in thematic groups and described by keywords and other attributes assigned by the publisher. Usually described by metadata with poor semantics, these datasets very often remain as “data silos”, with no explicit connection or data integration mechanism, making it difficult for the users to locate and interrelate relevant data sources. In contrast, the Semantic Web focuses on a way of modeling and representing data in an easier manner to establish interrelationships between data, accompanied by richer descriptors. Based on this scenario, this paper proposes LigADOS, an approach to create interconnections between datasets considering their content and related metadata. LigADOS is based on the principles of the Semantic Web and associated linked data solutions and technologies, to support rich access strategies to RDF data published using portal platforms like CKAN and others.","2021","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","","73-84","","","","","","LigADOS","Communications in Computer and Information Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Dataset interlinking; FAIR Data Point; Open data portals platforms; Semantic metadata interlinking","Garoufallou, Emmanouel; Ovalle-Perandones, María-Antonia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We systematically compare the open data inception and implementation processes, as well as their main results, in three Spanish local governments (Gava and Rubi in Catalonia and Gijon in Asturias) by using a model that combines the technology enactment framework with some specific constructs and relationships from the process model of computing change.

The basic assumption is that once data are more discoverable, accessible, available in alternative formats, and with licensing schemes that allow free re-use, diverse stakeholders will develop innovative data applications. Despite OGD's potential transformative value, there is limited evidence for such transformation, particularly due to scarce data use, which is partly attributable to the lack of technical skills and user training. To advance the dialogue around methods to increase awareness of OGD, improve users' skills to work with OGD, and encourage data use, the paper compares and contrasts how three training interventions in Spain, Italy, and the United States have sought to increase awareness of OGD, improve users' skills and potentially engage them in their use of OGD. We report three main findings. First, introduction and analysis skills are taught in combination to encourage use of open data. Being aware of OGD and its benefits is insufficient to promote use. Second, OGD training seems to be more effective when complemented with knowledge about context and interactions with government. Finally, embedding the training interventions in the specific contexts and considering the unique characteristics, interests, and expectations of different types of users is critical to success.","2018-04-01","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-11-15 20:44:14","233-242","","2","35","","Government Information Quarterly","Promoting the use of open government data","Agile Government and Adaptive Governance in the Public Sector","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Citizen engagement; Information literacy; Open government data; Open government data skills; Open government data users; Training programs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Open datasets are provided to facilitate civic engagement and government transparency. However, making the data available does not guarantee usage. This paper examined the nature of context-related information provided together with the datasets and identified the challenges users encounter while using the resources. Design/methodology/approach The authors extracted descriptive text provided together with (often at the top of) datasets (N = 216) and the nature of questions and comments users post in relation to the dataset. They then segmented text descriptions and user comments into “idea units” and applied open-coding with constant comparison method. This allowed them to come up with thematic issues that descriptions focus on and the challenges users encounter. Findings Results of the analysis revealed that context-related descriptions are limited and normative. Users are expected to figure out how to use the data. Analysis of user comments/questions revealed four areas of challenge they encounter: organization and accessibility of the data, clarity and completeness, usefulness and accuracy and language (spelling and grammar). Data providers can do more to address these issues. Research limitations/implications The purpose of the study is to understand the nature of open data provision and suggest ways of making open data more accessible to “non expert users”. As such, it is not focused on generalizing about open data provision in various countries as such provision may be different based on jurisdiction. Practical implications The study provides insight about ways of organizing open dataset that the resource can be accessible by the general public. It also provides suggestions about how open data providers could consider users' perspectives including providing continuous support. Originality/value Research on open data often focuses on technological, policy and political perspectives.  Arguably, this is the first study on analysis of context-related information in open-datasets. Datasets do not “speak for themselves” because they require context for analysis and interpretation. Understanding the nature of context-related information in open dataset is original idea.","2020-01-01","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-10-25 10:58:21","19-36","","1/2","121","","","How “accessible” is open data?","","","","","","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/622B5LYK/html.html","","","Accessibility; Civic engagement; Data and context; Data literacy; Open data; Open data usage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed approach uses Web augmentation techniques and voice interaction to help users in finding relevant open data by offering them various useful comments, including a full fledged voice interaction interface. Thereby, WAFRA4OD enables visually impaired data enthusiasts to explore and interact with open data portals using voice commands, and thus improves the accessibility of open data.

The majority were put in place by international agencies for monitoring purposes as well as to help National Statistical Offices to improve the dissemination of data to a broader public. Based on an analysis of several data portals in a variety of countries, this paper offers lessons on how the deployment, design and technology considerations can be improved as we enter the implementation phase of the Sustainable Development Goals – which will lead to a further push for data portals. The paper finds that while there have been many good intentions to make these portals available to countries, when it comes to the actual implementation the outcomes are rather mixed. One particular problem is the set-up of data portals with overlapping functionalities and their lack of integration – particularly in the most aid-dependent countries. This results in (i) a duplication of workload for already resource-constrained NSOs who have to maintain several portals and update information manually, (ii) confusion for users who consult the various portals with often conflicting results, and (iii) overall high costs for demonstrably low usage of these portals. The paper concludes with recommendations for international agencies and NSOs when deploying new data portals.","","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/LH2Z2ISR/Greenwell et al_Making Data Portals work for SDGs.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within the democratic tradition, transparency is seen as a fundamental element of democratic governance. While the use of open government data has the potential to enhance transparency and trust in government, realising any ideal of transparent democratic governance implies responding to a range of sociotechnical design challenges. In order to address these design challenges it is essential to adopt an interdisciplinary and stakeholder-engaged approach to research and innovation. In the current study, we describe a contextualist approach to the design of an open data collaboration platform in the context of an EU innovation project, focused on enhancing transparency and collaboration between citizens and public administrators through the use of open government data. We report on a collective intelligence scenario-based design process that has shaped the development of open data platform requirements and ongoing system engineering and evaluation work. Stakeholders across five pilot sites identified barriers to accessing, understanding, and using open data, and options to overcome these barriers across three broad categories: government and organisational issues; technical, data, and resource issues; and training and engagement issues. Stakeholders also expressed a broad variety of user needs across three domains: information needs; social-collaborative needs; and understandability, usability, and decision-making needs.

Current methods of data analysis, particularly before model development, are costly and not standardized. The Dataset Nutrition Label (the Label) is a diagnostic framework that lowers the barrier to standardized data analysis by providing a distilled yet comprehensive overview of dataset ""ingredients"" before AI model development. Building a Label that can be applied across domains and data types requires that the framework itself be flexible and adaptable; as such, the Label is comprised of diverse qualitative and quantitative modules generated through multiple statistical and probabilistic modelling backends, but displayed in a standardized format. To demonstrate and advance this concept, we generated and published an open source prototype with seven sample modules on the ProPublica Dollars for Docs dataset. The benefits of the Label are manyfold. For data specialists, the Label will drive more robust data analysis practices, provide an efficient way to select the best dataset for their purposes, and increase the overall quality of AI models as a result of more robust training datasets and the ability to check for issues at the time of model development. For those building and publishing datasets, the Label creates an expectation of explanation, which will drive better data collection practices.

Several vocabularies have been developed to describe datasets in order to increase their discoverability, but for data publishers is costly to cumbersome to annotate them using all, leading to the question of what properties are more important. In this work we contribute with a systematic study of the patterns and specific attributes that data consumers use to search for data and how it compares with general web search. We performed a query log analysis based on logs from four national open data portals and conducted a qualitative analysis of user data requests for requests issued to one of them. Search queries issued on data portals differ from those issued to web search engines in their length, topic, and structure. Based on our findings we hypothesise that portals search functionalities are currently used in an exploratory manner, rather than to retrieve a specific resource. In our study of data requests we found that geospatial and temporal attributes, as well as information on the required granularity of the data are the most common features. The findings of both analyses suggest that these features are of higher importance in dataset retrieval in contrast to general web search, suggesting that efforts of dataset publishers should focus on generating dataset descriptions including them.","2019-03-01","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-11-15 20:55:06","37-55","","","55","","Journal of Web Semantics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/R6DILX7A/Kacprzak et al_2019_Characterising dataset search—An analysis of search logs and data requests.pdf","","","Dataset search; Search logs; Vertical search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

O foco desta pesquisa abrange a identificação dos mecanismos que ampliam a transparência em portais de DAG brasileiros. Por intermédio da literatura científica e da coleta de dados com especialistas e usuários, foram propostos 18 mecanismos que visam a ampliar o grau de transparência em portais de DAG. Os resultados demonstraram que a evolução do uso e das pesquisas sobre dados abertos possibilitaram agregar os mecanismos de autenticidade, irrefutabilidade, integridade, conformidade, amplitude, confiabilidade, compreensibilidade, participação cidadã, integridade referencial e dados conectados aos 8 mecanismos originais definidos pelo Open Government Working Group (OGWG). A classificação desses mecanismos e a definição de identificadores possibilitaram avaliar o principal portal de DAG brasileiro: o <http://dados.gov.br>.

This is a serious risk that could disrupt the Open Data project, as well as e-government initiatives since the data quality needs to be managed to guarantee the reliability of e-government to the public. First quality assessment frameworks emerge to evaluate the quality for a given dataset or portal along various dimensions (e.g., information completeness). Nonetheless, a common problem with such frameworks is to provide meaningful ranking mechanisms that are able to integrate several quality dimensions and user preferences (e.g., a portal provider is likely to have different quality preferences than a portal consumer). To address this multi-criteria decision making problem, our research work applies AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process), which compares 146 active Open Data portals across 44 countries, powered by the CKAN software.","2016-06-08","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-11-15","397–407","","","","","","","dg.o '16","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/FHUU5TXA/Kubler et al_2016_Open Data Portal Quality Comparison using AHP.pdf","","","Analytic Hierarchy Process; Data Quality; E-government; Multi-Criteria Decision Making; Open Data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The methodology follows a systematic search for the relevant resources, their classification and identification of six open data benchmarks to be further analyzed, the identification of their key components through decomposition, their description, and identifying the similarities and differences. Three major groups of indices and four periods that characterize the efforts to benchmark and measure the development of open data are identified, where the first measure the openness of the selected categories of data, the second focuses on different aspects of the open data ecosystem, using a large number of variables, and the third is a combination of both approaches. Recommendations as well as trends that can form the benchmarking frameworks in the future are also discussed. The findings are of a high importance for individual countries, which allow for correct and accurate interpretation of the results changes in the scope of a given index or rank, i.e., whether the difference in results is the result of national efforts or the subject of changes in the specific index, as well as how to combine and interpret the results of a number of indices for correct decision-making and for the definition of the future actions where the results vary significantly.

However, the influence of multiple–actors on the decision-making process is ill-understood. Stakeholders play different roles and have different interests in opening and analyzing datasets. The objective of this paper is to understand the influence of the stakeholder’s roles and their interests in the decision-making process to open data. The roles-interest grid method is used to determine the stakeholder’s concerns and how they influence the decision-making process to open data. In addition to stakeholder theory, we employ muddling through and bounded rationality theories to create a comprehensive analysis of the decision-making process. Stakeholders are found to be diverse, where some are proponents of opening data, and others are risk-averse and do not favor disclosing data. Stakeholder’s responsible for the actual opening of data are often focused on the risks resulting in a tension between the ambitions of politicians to open data, and the practices of administrators and decision-makers. Understanding the stakeholder’s roles and their tensions can help to ensure better decisions are made. We recommend creating incentives for generating shared objectives.","2020","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","","331-340","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/X2A8BV5B/Luthfi et al_2020_Stakeholder Tensions in Decision-Making for Opening Government Data.pdf","","","Bounded rationality; Decision-making; Interest; Muddling through; Open government data; Roles; Stakeholder","Shishkov, Boris","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aim to address this by detecting and establishing links to geo-entities in the datasets found in Open Data catalogs and their respective metadata descriptions and link them to a knowledge graph of geo-entities. This knowledge graph does not yet readily exist, though, or at least, not a single one: so, we integrate and interlink several datasets to construct our (extensible) base geo-entities knowledge graph: (i) the openly available geospatial data repository GeoNames, (ii) the map service OpenStreetMap, (iii) country-speciﬁc sets of postal codes, and (iv) the European Union’s classiﬁcation system NUTS. As a second step, this base knowledge graph is used to add semantic labels to the open datasets, i.e., we heuristically disambiguate the geo-entities in CSV columns using the context of the labels and the hierarchical graph structure of our base knowledge graph. Finally, in order to interact with and retrieve the content, we index the datasets and provide a demo user interface.

In order to get a more complete picture of the severity of these issues, the present work aims at developing a generic metadata quality assessment framework for various Open Data portals: We treat data portals independently from the portal software frameworks by mapping the specific metadata of three widely used portal software frameworks (CKAN, Socrata, OpenDataSoft) to the standardized Data Catalog Vocabulary metadata schema. We subsequently define several quality metrics, which can be evaluated automatically and in an efficient manner. Finally, we report findings based on monitoring a set of over 260 Open Data portals with 1.1M datasets.

It is one of the primary principles of open data, which is considered to be a success factor, while at the same time it is one of the biggest barriers that can disrupt users trust in data and even the desire to use the entire open data portal. However, assessing this aspect is a very difficult task that, in most cases, becomes an impossible for open data users. There is therefore a lack of comparative studies on the timeliness of data of different national open data portals. Unfortunately, 2020 gave the opportunity to find out this. It became easy enough to compare how long is the data path from the data holder to the OGD portal by analysing the timeliness of Covid-19-related data sets in relation to the first case observed in a country. The study thus fills the gap of comparative studies by addressing 60 countries and their OGD portals concerning the timeliness of the data, providing a report on how much and what countries provide the open data as quickly as possible. It makes it possible to understand how quickly OGD portals react to emergencies by opening and updating data for their further potential reuse, which is essential in the digital data-driven world.","2020-10","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","","131-138","","","","","","Timeliness of Open Data in Open Government Data Portals Through Pandemic-related Data","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/L8T4MGTE/Nikiforova_2020_Timeliness of Open Data in Open Government Data Portals Through.pdf; /Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/5AI9F8UX/9264298.html","","","Covid-19; COVID-19; Europe; frequency of updates; Government; open data; open government data; pandemic; Pandemics; portal; Portals; Time-frequency analysis; timeliness; Viruses (medical)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 Fourth International Conference on Multimedia Computing, Networking and Applications (MCNA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in order for open government data to be fully taken advantage of, it must be found, understood, and used. Though many countries maintain open government data portals, the usability of said portals can vary greatly; this is important to understand as the usability of a portal likely impacts the eventual reuse of the data made available there. Acknowledging the importance of portal usability to the data reuse process, this paper helps to elucidate some initial insights by asking two questions: “How can the usability of open government data portals be evaluated and compared across contexts?” and “What are the most commonly missing usability aspects from open government data portals?”. In order to answer these research questions, a subset of 41 national open government data portals were selected for an in-depth usability analysis drawing on the feedback from 40 individual users. As a result of this analysis, the paper is able to make three primary contributions: (1) the validation of a framework for open government data portal usability analysis, (2) develops an initial comparative international ranking of open government data portal usability, and (3) identifies commonly occurring portal usability strengths and weaknesses across contexts.","2021-05-01","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-10-25 11:51:19","101539","","","58","","Telematics and Informatics","Open government data portal usability","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/JQT75FBQ/Nikiforova_McBride_2021_Open government data portal usability.pdf","","","Open data; Open data portal; Open government data; Usability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main way to disseminate this availability of data has been the deployment of Open Data catalogs exposing metadata of these datasets, which are easily indexed by web search engines. Open Source platforms have facilitated enormously the labor of institutions involved in Open Data initiatives, making the setup of Open Data portals almost a trivial task. However, few approaches have analyzed how precisely metadata describes the associated datasets. Taking into account the existing approaches for analyzing the quality of metadata in the Open Data context and other related domains, this work contributes to the state of the art by extending an ISO 19157 based method for checking the quality of geographic metadata to the context of Open Data metadata. Focusing on metadata models compliant with the Data Catalog Vocabulary proposed by W3C, the proposed extended method has been applied for the evaluation of the Open Data catalog of the Spanish Government. The results have been also compared with those obtained by the Metadata Quality Assessment methodology proposed at the European Data Portal.","2021","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","","60364-60382","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/GMJZN8DR/9405650.html; /Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/486PZD5S/Nogueras-Iso et al_2021_Quality of Metadata in Open Data Portals.pdf","","","ISO 19157; ISO Standards; Measurement; metadata; Metadata; metadata quality assessment; open data; Open data; Portals; quality; Standards; Vocabulary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has consequently limited the innovation and transparency impact of open data on respective economies and governments. While literature is replete with articles on barriers to open data exploitation and use; these studies are yet to examine how affordances of open data platforms could help to overcome these barriers. This perspective is important since the platform directly mediates access to open data resources and their use.

This factor prevents citizens and civil society organizations from exploiting open data for their goals. The poor usability of current generation of open data platforms could be attributed to the fact that these platforms were not designed for non-technical users. They are typically software products developed ""by programmers for programmers or technical users"". Consequently, while reports about innovative use of open data by software developers and start-ups are common, there are very few reports about successful public use of open data to tackle concrete societal challenges. This paper provides the results and lessons learnt from the usability evaluation of the second alpha release of a next generation open data platform designed explicitly to support non-technical users. A scenario involving a transportation challenge in Dublin City was employed as the context for the evaluation of the platform. Findings provide some empirical basis for identifying important user interface design considerations, patterns for highly usable open data platforms and considerations for open data policy.","2017-06-07","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-11-16","495–504","","","","","","","dg.o '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/5H93MPZN/Osagie et al_2017_Usability Evaluation of an Open Data Platform.pdf","","","Open Data; Route-To-PA Platform; Usable Open Data Platform","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of an Open Data Portal is exposing data in such a way that reusing is facilitated. Therefore, it is necessary to define a quality and maturity model to evaluate the characteristics of an Open Data Portal, considering different factors that can contribute to reusing potential, such like visualization, usability, granularity, data integration, reputation, relevancy, availability and reutilization. Also, effectively promoting data reusing implies setting specific norms to promote standardization among institutions, ministries and central governments' offices into the same country.

As an effect, Open Data corpora has become so huge that it is impossible to deal with them by hand; as a consequence, it is necessary to develop tools for effectively querying corpora of open data, in order to find the desired data sets.In our previous work [1], we presented a novel technique to query open data corpora. In this paper, we present an evolution of that technique, obtained by refining some steps and by introducing some novelties. We still rely on the blindly querying approach: the user does not have to know in advance the actual structure of possibly thousands of data sets, but formulates the query trying to characterize the items of interests; in fact, a novelty of our approach is that our technique looks for single items within data sets, not for data sets. Then, the technique tries to rewrite the query by exploiting the catalog of the corpus in order to find the most similar and relevant terms.The main enhancement introduced in the technique and presented in this paper is the way the technique looks for similar terms in the catalog, that now is based on a semantic approach: the WordNet dictionary is exploited to get synonyms of terms in the query. Furthermore, a new set of experiments has been performed, in order to prove the effectiveness of the enhanced technique.","2018","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","","179-201","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Majchrzak, Tim A.; Traverso, Paolo; Krempels, Karl-Heinz; Monfort, Valérie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The open data approach can be used to increase the transparency of public administrations. Hence, thousands of open datasets published by governments, organizations and companies, were made available through portals on internet. In recent years, the growth in the number of portals and the amount of information available has increased users' difficulty in obtaining useful information for conducting analyzes or studies. In a majority of portals the datasets are distributed across selected topics or categories. As such, users may take some time to understand the organization of the datasets in each portal they browse, what hinders a comprehensive and effective access to information. In this work, we conducted a study about how the 100 different portals of the most populous cities in the United States categorize their datasets. As a result, we identified the most relevant categories, based on the frequency of occurrence in these portals. Furthermore, we suggest a method that provides a generic categorization of datasets among several urban data portals that could simplify user interaction with these portals.","2018-05-30","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-11-15","1–9","","","","","","How cities categorize datasets in their open data portals","dg.o '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/HYEB2EF5/Pinto et al_2018_How cities categorize datasets in their open data portals.pdf","","","categories in portals; electronic government; urban open data portals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims to explore the motivations of citizens who engage in open agriculture data hackathons. We conducted a case study and analyzed data collected from 161 participants of 11 farming hackathons held between 2016 and 2018 in the Netherlands. We found that participants of open agriculture data hackathons have different roles, including business developer, concept thinker, data analyst, data owner, developer, manager, marketer, problem owner, and student. Our analysis shows that citizens are predominantly motivated to engage in open agricultural data hackathons as part of their work. Furthermore, developers and problem owners are mainly motivated by fun and enjoyment. This indicates that it is important for open data policymakers and hackathon organizers to consider different approaches based on citizens’ roles when organizing open data hackathons. This paper contributes to the literature by providing insight in the motivations of citizens engaging in open agriculture data hackathons in comparison with hackathons in other sectors, and by mapping citizens’ roles to their motivations for engaging in such hackathons.","2019","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","","130-141","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/256PLXIX/Purwanto et al_2019_Citizens’ Motivations for Engaging in Open Data Hackathons.pdf","","","Agriculture; Citizen engagement; Hackathon; Open data; Open Government Data","Panagiotopoulos, Panos; Edelmann, Noella; Glassey, Olivier; Misuraca, Gianluca; Parycek, Peter; Lampoltshammer, Thomas; Re, Barbara","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, studies that empirically test this assumption are scarce. Using the Information Systems (IS) Success Model as a theoretical basis, this study aims to examine the effects of data quality, system quality, and service quality on citizens’ trust in OGD. We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the 200 responses to our online questionnaire. We found that trust in OGD can be predicted by citizens’ perceptions of OGD system quality and service quality. Furthermore, citizens’ perception of service quality positively influences their perceptions of data and system quality, whereas citizens’ perception of system quality positively influences their perception of data quality. This study is among the first that quantitatively examines the effects of data quality, service quality, and system quality on citizen's trust in OGD. It contributes to the scientific literature by providing an operationalization of elements of the IS Success Model in the context of OGD and by developing and applying a model of factors influencing citizen's trust in OGD. While previous research finds that perceived data quality is the most crucial driver for trust in OGD, our study finds that citizens’ perception of OGD service quality is a more important driver for trust in OGD. With regard to the practical contributions of this study, open data policymakers should be aware that citizens’ perceptions on data quality can be greatly improved when appropriate human services are provided (e.g., designated civil servants offering support or help to data users) in addition to the provision of OGD portal functionalities (e.g., data visualization and comparison tools).","2020-06-15","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-10-25","310–318","","","","","","Citizens&#x2019; Trust in Open Government Data","dg.o '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/E4TP4KQI/Purwanto et al_2020_Citizens' Trust in Open Government Data.pdf","","","citizen engagement; data quality; Information Systems Success Model; Open Government Data; service quality; Structural Equation Modeling; systems quality; trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the number of open data portals grows over the years, researchers have been able to identify recurrent problems with the data they provide, such as lack of data standards, difficulty in data access and poor understandability. Such issues make difficult the effective use of data. Several works in literature propose different approaches to mitigate these issues, based on novel or well-known data management techniques. However, there is a lack of general frameworks for tackling these problems. On the other hand, data governance has been applied in large companies to manage data problems, ensuring that data meets business needs and become organizational assets.

This study, therefore, argues that next to general requirements: we also need to collect context-specific user requirements for open data platforms. We take different societal issues as the starting point for open data platform design. To illustrate the value of this context-specific approach, we apply scenario-based design methodology in the Province of Groningen in The Netherlands. The results show that different scenarios result partly in similar but also partly in different user requirements, leading to a deeper and richer understanding of user requirements. We conclude that a context-specific approach thereby connecting data, users and societal issues can be used to guide government agencies and designers in efforts to develop open data platforms that actually meet the needs of citizens.","2017-09-01","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-10-25 13:06:57","470-480","","3","34","","Government Information Quarterly","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/DZ4T6V8A/Ruijer et al_2017_Connecting societal issues, users and data.pdf","","","Open data platform; Scenario-based design; Societal issues; User requirements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study develops a Democratic Activity Model of Open Data Use, which is illustrated by an exploratory qualitative multiple case study outlining three democratic processes: monitorial, deliberative and participatory.

As a result, we can witness an increasing amount of government open data shared on public government's portals that become sources of rich big data. While this scenario provides data transparency and eases accessibility for public data consumers, the quality aspect, or the veracity property (as commonly coined to big data) of open data is the topic of concerned. Not only poor quality data causes misleading results, the reputation of the government as an open data provider can also be negatively affected. Thus, to understand how the government's portals deal with the veracity aspect of their data, in this paper, we present the results of examining quality criteria imposed by selected government's data portals for their data contributors. In particular, we extract quality criteria from the open data policy of the government's data portals under study. The result shows that out of 108 portals, only 27% of the portals explicitly state their quality criteria in the policy, with varying coverage of quality criteria. The frequency of the identified 15 quality criteria shows the types of quality criteria that receive more (and less) attention by the open data portals based on their relative importance.

However, most existing solutions have not been envisaged as sustainable approaches to cope with key data attributes such as timeliness, accessibility and usability. In this paper, we present a framework that addresses these challenges and ensures the efficient publication of dynamic data on open data platforms, as well as improving the consumption experience of end-users. The framework describes the architecture of a sustainable system that can operate continuously in an automated way. It involves: 1) introducing an evolvable and scalable ecosystem to guarantee the access to dynamic data when they are made available; 2) tackling governance using an autonomous agent to provide the capacity of dynamically publishing/unpublishing data resources on open data platforms. It ensures easier accessibility and greater efficiency for data developers, facilitating the development of data-enabled products, thus helping developers to seize the opportunities of the data economy; and 3) improving the consumption experience by introducing conversational bots, which enhances the usability of open data. We demonstrate the results and validity of the solution in practice through its implementation, evaluation and exploitation as a practical system in the Parliament of the Canary Islands, Spain. The framework developed can be considered a generic solution to manage open data publishing and consumption challenges in other domains.","2021","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","","151841-151863","","","9","","","SuDaMa","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/8E722AUN/Sánchez-Nielsen et al_2021_SuDaMa.pdf; /Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/ZYLXRLK5/9611269.html","","","dynamic open data; Economics; Ecosystems; Europe; Open data; open data consumption; Open data framework; open data publishing; open data sustainability; Publishing; Technological innovation; Usability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the case study of an open data portal being developed at an inter- and transdisciplinary research institute, we argue that datafication and dataism are highly problematic trends, because they marginalize qualitative data employed in critical, constructivist, and other interpretive methods, thereby limiting the possibility of complementing and extending each other. Nonetheless, we also maintain that these trends are not technologically determined but are modifiable, based on the design of data portals.

The authors also use a taxonomy of data collaborative forms from a previous empirical study to discuss how different forms of data collaboratives may require different coordination mechanisms. Findings The study analyzed data collaboratives from the perspective of organizational and task levels. At the organizational level, the authors argue that data collaboratives present an example of the bazaar form of coordination. At the task level, the authors identified five coordination problems and discussed potential coordination mechanisms to address them, such as coordination by negotiation, by third party, by standardization, to name a few.

These actions offer the potential to improve both transportation safety and mobility. That said, an examination of the quality of data, ease of use, and availability of metadata across agencies revealed a significant variation among them and presented a serious concern to realizing the full potential of these principled efforts. This study highlights the imminent need for agency support towards assessing data warehouse quality and in establishing an index to measure performance. The approach includes a data portal evaluation rubric (DPER) that captures the essence of the National Open Data Policy. Its metrics are devised from practices implemented across several agencies to ensure the effective use of open data. The proposed DPER was applied to 43 transportation-related open data portals at the state (39) and national level (4). The DPER examines the quality, the openness of data, and the relevance of published content to the Transportation industry. The evaluation found that the portal hosted by the state of New York scored the highest due to its user-friendly interface with interactive visualization tools, relevant data content, detailed information about the data, and the useful API (Application Program Interface) references for application developers. The absolute scramble by agencies to fight the life-impacting events of 2020 emphasizes both the need and urgency to provide standardized, accessible, and accurate data for a ubiquitous audience.","2020-08-01","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-11-15 17:16:52","181-198","","2","2","","J.

Thus, we focus on a core question about analysing and guiding the development of local OGD portals. An evaluation framework is developed based on the comparison of related studies and principles. To fill the gap in existing frameworks which lack clarity in the prioritization process, Analytic Hierarchy Process together with an expert survey is used to derive priorities of elements of the framework. To test the capability of the framework in analysing and guiding the development of local OGD portals, a case study of Chinese province-level OGD portals has been carried out. Results show that data accessibility and quality matter more than data quantity for a local OGD portal. Currently, Chinese province-level OGD portals are in their infancy of development, with a great gap between Taiwan and Hong Kong with other portals. Data relating to local statistics, credit records, and budget and spending are well released on portals in China. Population size and the size and wealth of the local government show no significant relation with the number of datasets. By combining priorities of the framework with evaluation results, it could help local governments to recognise their present shortcomings and give them recommendations for recognizing directions for OGD portal's future development.","2018-10-01","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-10-25 10:47:55","644-656","","4","35","","Government Information Quarterly","A prioritization-based analysis of local open government data portals","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/HKYYJAEM/Wang et al_2018_A prioritization-based analysis of local open government data portals.pdf","","","Analytic hierarchy process; Data evaluation; Evaluation framework; Local government; Open government data; Open government data portal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To describe and monitor the state of open data in countries and organisations, several open data assessment frameworks were developed. Despite high scores in these assessment frameworks, the actual (re)use of open government data (OGD) fails to live up to its expectations. Our review of existing open data assessment frameworks reveals that these only cover parts of the open data ecosystem. We have developed a framework, which assesses open data supply, open data governance, and open data user characteristics holistically. This holistic open data framework assesses the maturity of the open data ecosystem and proves to be a useful tool to indicate which aspects of the open data ecosystem are successful and which aspects require attention. Our initial assessment in the Netherlands indicates that the traditional geographical data perform significantly better than non-geographical data, such as healthcare data. Therefore, open geographical data policies in the Netherlands may provide useful cues for other OGD strategies.","2017-03-04","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-03 11:11:54","284-306","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2016.1224938","","/Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/VJVRA3LB/17538947.2016.html; /Users/timdavies/Zotero/storage/L477AURG/Welle Donker_van Loenen_2017_How to assess the success of the open data ecosystem.pdf","","","assessment framework; geodata; Open data; open data governance; open data maturity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this research gap, we have designed a quality framework that is able to evaluate data quality in Open Data portals on dedicated and fine-grained dimensions, such as interoperability, findability, uniqueness or completeness. Additionally, we propose quality measures that allow for valid assessments regarding cross-portal findability and uniqueness of dataset descriptions.

Design/methodology/approach Based on the review of the existing quality evaluation methods of open government data, the evaluation metrics and their weights were determined by 15 experts in health through the Delphi method and analytic hierarchy process. The authors tested the framework's applicability using open government health data related to COVID-19 in the US, EU and China. Findings The results of the test capture the quality difference of the current open government health data. At present, the open government health data in the US, EU and China lacks the necessary metadata. Besides, the number, richness of content and timeliness of open datasets need to be improved.

Issues on open data were also intensively discussed from researchers and practitioners. One of the key issues in adopting open data is the accessibility of the data, which are generally collectively provided in open data portals. Open data portals categorize open datasets according to their domains, providers, formats, and other properties for better accessibility of the data. However, these portals did not follow a conforming standard in establishing their categorization structures. In this work, we try to assess the goodness of categorization structures of open data portals automatically by investigating the coherence of the datasets in the same category. The detailed methodology is described but preliminary experiments on Taiwan’s open data portals are still undergoing.","2015","2021-12-08 11:37:38","2021-12-08 11:37:38","","372-380","","","","","","","Communications in Computer and Information Science","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Categorization structure; Open data; Open data portal; Quality assessment","Wang, Leon; Uesugi, Shiro; Ting, I-Hsien; Okuhara, Koji; Wang, Kai","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework was then used to evaluate the current OGD sites created and maintained by 34 U.S. municipal government agencies. The results show that, overall, portals perform well in terms of providing access, but not so well in helping users understand and engage with data. These findings indicate room for improvement in multiple areas and suggest potential roles for information professionals as data mediators. The study also reveals that portals using the Socrata platform performed better, regarding user access, trust, engagement, and participation. However, the variability among portals indicates that some portals should improve their platforms to achieve greater user engagement and participation.
